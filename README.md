# Caps-lock-and-num-lock-notification
caps-notify.sh sends a notification when you press capslock, num-notify.sh does the same for numlock.
To use them you need to place in the same folder as the 2 mentioned above this script https://github.com/vlevit/notify-send.sh/blob/master/notify-send.sh

Now map the keys to the corresponding script and that's it.
